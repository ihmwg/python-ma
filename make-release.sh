# First, do

# - Update ChangeLog.rst and util/python-modelcif.spec with the release number
# - Update release number in modelcif/__init__.py and setup.py
# - Commit, tag, and push
# - Make release on GitHub
# - Upload the release tarball from
#   https://github.com/ihmwg/python-modelcif/releases to Zenodo as a new release
# - Build SRPM and upload to COPR
# - Make sure there are no extraneous .py files (setup.py will include them
#   in the pypi package)
